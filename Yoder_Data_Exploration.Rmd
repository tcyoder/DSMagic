Using Data Science to Create Disney Magic - Data Exploration   
============================================================

Let's begin!

Previewing the Data
------------------

What exactly did Touring Plans give us? Let's load in one of my of my favorite rides, Spaceship Earth, and the meta data file.

```{r Load Data}
SpaceshipEarth <- read.csv(file= "Data/spaceship_earth.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE, sep=",")

MetaData <- read.csv(file= "Data/metadata.csv", stringsAsFactors =FALSE, header=TRUE, sep=",")

```

Let's see what the attraction data sets look like. 

```{r Preview Data}
head(SpaceshipEarth)
```

For each ride we get the date of the observation, time, posted wait time (SPOSTMIN) and actual wait time (SACTMIN). Hmm, might have some NA cleaning to do.

```{r Structure of Spaceship Earth}
str(SpaceshipEarth)
```

Checking out the structure of the Spaceship Earth set, it looks like we have 240919 observations. 
Just how many NAs are in the Actual Wait time field though? How many actual values?

```{r NA Count}
#How many NAs?
sum(is.na(SpaceshipEarth$SACTMIN))
#How many actual values?
sum(!is.na(SpaceshipEarth$SACTMIN))
```

Yikes! Since it seems Actual Wait Time will not be useful, let's focus on posted wait time.

What fields do we have in the Metadata file?

```{r Structure of Metadata}
str(MetaData)
```

That is a lot of metadata! I will study the data dictionary and let you know what is what as we use it. 


Preparing the Data
------------------

Let's load some libraries and really start digging in.

```{r Loading Libraries}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(caret)
```

Let's fix up some of these date fields to help us out down the line.

```{r Correcting date fields}

SpaceshipEarth$date <- as.Date(SpaceshipEarth$date, "%m/%d/%Y")
MetaData$DATE <- as.Date(MetaData$DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")

```


Let's make some nice data frames removing the Actual Wait Time field, the NAs from the Posted Wait Time field, and the '-999' entries from posted wait times and check out some basic stats. According to the data dictionary '-999' indicates the attraction was closed. It's a shame Actual Wait Time had so many NAs as that would have been a nice chance for some feature engineering.   

```{r Tidying up Attraction DFsl}

#Removing the NAs
SpaceshipEarth_Clean <- SpaceshipEarth[complete.cases(SpaceshipEarth[, 3]),]

#Remove 2018 observations                     
SpaceshipEarth_Clean <- SpaceshipEarth_Clean[format(SpaceshipEarth_Clean$date, '%Y') != "2018", ]

#Piping the changes 
SpaceshipEarth_Clean <- SpaceshipEarth_Clean %>%
                      #Drop the actual wait time column 
                      select (-c(SACTMIN)) %>%
                      #Add a month column
                      mutate(month = month(SpaceshipEarth_Clean$date)) %>%
                      #Add a year column
                      mutate(year = year(SpaceshipEarth_Clean$date)) %>%
                      #Add a day column 
                      mutate(day = day(SpaceshipEarth_Clean$date)) %>%
                      #Add a weekday column
                      mutate(weekday = as.factor(weekdays(SpaceshipEarth_Clean$date))) %>%
                      #Remove the -999 observations 
                      filter(SpaceshipEarth_Clean$SPOSTMIN >= 0) 

```

Now that we've cleaned up our data frame, let's add in all that metadata!

```{r Joining the Metadata}
SpaceshipEarth_meta <- left_join(SpaceshipEarth_Clean, MetaData, by=c("date" = "DATE"))
```

Checking out the density of our posted wait times.

```{r Density of Wait Times}
ggplot(SpaceshipEarth_meta,aes(x=SPOSTMIN)) + geom_density(fill="light blue", color="blue") +
  labs(x="Posted Wait Time (Minutes)", y="Density", title="Density Plot of Posted Wait Times at Spaceship Earth") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=15)
```

Time to add any binary variables necessary. Most were already added in the metadata. I will take this time to remove some of the variables that are specific to other parks or are duplicates of variables I created on my own. On a bigger project using a computer with more power I would have left these variables in. For the purposes of this project I think we will be okay!  

```{r Binary Variables and Modifications}

#Removing variables 
SpaceshipEarth_meta <- SpaceshipEarth_meta[-c(9:13, 19, 61:69, 79:107, 119:144, 150:157, 158:171, 176:196)]

#Binary field for under 10 minute posted wait
SpaceshipEarth_meta$SPOSTMIN_BINARY <- ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$SPOSTMIN <= 10,1,0) #1 is under 10 minute wait
SpaceshipEarth_meta$SPOSTMIN_BINARY <- as.factor(SpaceshipEarth_meta$SPOSTMIN_BINARY)

#Binary field for party season 
SpaceshipEarth_meta$PARTYSEASON_BINARY <- ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$PARTYSEASON_WDW == "NONE",0,1) #0 is no active party 

#Converting inSession character field to numeric 
SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession <- as.numeric(sub("%", "", SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession))

#Add categorical column splitting percentage of in-session schools to 25% ranges
SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession_Cat <- ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession >= 0 & SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession <=25,1,
                                            ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession > 25 & SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession <=50,2,
                                                   ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession > 50 & SpaceshipEarth_meta$inSession <=75,3,4)))

#Parse the time from datetime
SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime <- strftime(SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime, format="%H:%M:%S")

#Time category variable
SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime_Cat <- ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime >= 00:00 & SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime <=12:00,1,
                                            ifelse(SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime > 12:00 & SpaceshipEarth_meta$datetime <=17:00,2,3))

                                                       
```

Splitting the Data
------------------

Split up into our test and training sets 80/20. 

```{r Splitting into Fit and Test Sets}
set.seed(360)
#SE_Split <- sample(nrow(SpaceshipEarth_meta),0.2 * nrow(SpaceshipEarth_meta))

SE_Split <- createDataPartition(SpaceshipEarth_meta$SPOSTMIN_BINARY, p = .8,
                                list = FALSE,
                                times = 1)
SE_fit <- SpaceshipEarth_meta[SE_Split,]
SE_test <- SpaceshipEarth_meta[-SE_Split,] 
```


Now we can safely look at some stats and maybe even make some graphs. Fun! Here come the variables!

```{r Attraction Summary Stats}
summary(SE_fit)
```


Line Plots
----------

Let's see how much wait times have varied through one of the rides through the years. Have they slowly increased or stayed about the same?

```{r Annual Average Posted Wait}

# Create a data frame of what we want to plot
SE_Years <- SE_fit %>%
                group_by(year) %>%
                summarise(avg = mean(SPOSTMIN))

# Plot it!
ggplot(data=SE_Years, aes(x=year, y=avg, group=1)) + 
        geom_line(color="blue") +
        geom_point()+
        xlab("Year")+
        ylab("Average Posted Wait Time (Minutes)")+
        ggtitle("Average Posted Wait Times for Spaceship Earth")+
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
```

Average wait times seem to have increased through the years. According to this site - https://disneynews.us/disney-parks-attendance/
overall attendance has increased at the parks through the years so that provides an explanation. 

How do wait times look month to month? Let's look at 2015 and 2016; Two years that had similar average wait times. 
Is there a monthly pattern?

```{r Monthly Average Posted Wait}

# Creating a new data frame to fit what we want to plot 
SE_Months <- SE_fit %>%
                filter(year == 2015 | year == 2016) %>%
                group_by(month, year) %>%
                summarise(avg = mean(SPOSTMIN))

# Plot it! 
ggplot(SE_Months, aes(month, label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE,
                      avg, group=factor(year), color=factor(year))) +
                  geom_line() +
                  geom_point() +
                  labs(x="Month", y="Average Posted Wait Time (Minutes)", 
                  color="Year", title="Average Posted Wait Times for Spaceship Earth ") +
                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
                  xlim("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

```

Visually it seems we have a relationship between the month and the average wait time. If I were a betting man I would say we will see a pattern in day of the week as well..  

```{r Weekly Average Wait Times}
   
SE_Weekday <- SE_fit %>%
                filter(year == 2015 | year == 2016) %>%
                group_by(weekday, year) %>%
                summarise(avg = mean(SPOSTMIN))

ggplot(SE_Weekday, aes(weekday, label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE,
                      avg, group=factor(year), color=factor(year))) +
                  geom_line() +
                  geom_point() +
                  labs(x="Weekday", y="Average Posted Wait Time (Minutes)", 
                  color="Year", title="Average Posted Wait Times for Spaceship Earth ") +
                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
                  xlim("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
```


Histogram
---------

Let's see how some of these metadata variables look. How many observations take place during an event? 

```{r Histogram of Events}
ggplot(SE_fit) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=EPevent), fill = " dark blue") + 
  labs(x="Event (Yes or No)", y="Number of Observations", title="Observations During an Event") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Looks like nearly half of the observations take place during an event. EPCOT does host a few festivals. 


Scatterplots
------------

Do number of firework shows a night affect wait times?

```{r Scatter with number of Fireworks Shows}
ggplot(data=SE_fit) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=EPFIREWK, y=SPOSTMIN)) + 
  labs(x="Number of Fireworks Shows that Day", y="Posted Wait Times (Minutes)", title="Posted Wait Times per Number of Firework Shows")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

I wonder if not firework shows were days with poor weather? That would be interesting to see. One firework show days are also mostly likely the greatest occuring. 

What about holidays and wait times?

```{r Scatter of Holidays and Wait Times}
ggplot(data=SE_fit) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=HOLIDAY, y=SPOSTMIN)) + 
  labs(x="Holiday (Yes or No)", y="Posted Wait Times (Minutes)", title="Holidays vs Posted Wait Times")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The holiday metric breaks down each holiday on a 1 to 5 scale. For example Christmas is a 5, President's Day is a 1. Sorry Presidents. 

```{r Scatter of Holiday Metric}
ggplot(data=SE_fit) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=HOLIDAYM, y=SPOSTMIN)) + 
  labs(x="Holiday Metric", y="Posted Wait Times (Minutes)", title="Holiday Metric vs Posted Wait Times")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Run Disney race days.

```{r Scatter of Run Disney Race Days}
ggplot(data=SE_fit) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=WDWrace, y=SPOSTMIN)) + 
  labs(x="WDW Race Day (Yes or No)", y="Posted Wait Times (Minutes)", title="Run Disney Race Days vs Posted Wait Times")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


Earlier I added a categorical range (by 25%) of the percentage of schools in session. Category 1 is 0 - 25% of schools are in session, category 2 is 25-50% of schools are in session etc. 

```{r Scatter of In session Schools}
ggplot(data=SE_fit) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=inSession_Cat, y=SPOSTMIN)) + 
  labs(x="Percentage of Schools in Session", y="Posted Wait Times (Minutes)", title="Percentage of In Session Schools vs Posted Wait Times")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


Density Plots
-------------

Maximum temperature and minimum temparture density plots.

```{r Denisty Plot of Max Temperatures}
ggplot(SE_fit) + geom_density(aes(x=SE_fit$WDWMAXTEMP)) + 
  labs(x="Maximum Temperature", y="Density", title="Density Plot of Maximum Temperatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r Density Plot of Minimum Temperature}
ggplot(SE_fit) + geom_density(aes(x=SE_fit$WDWMINTEMP)) + 
  labs(x="Minimum Temperature", y="Density", title="Density Plot of Minimum Temperatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```



```{r Density Plot of Open Hours}
ggplot(SE_fit) + geom_density(aes(x=SE_fit$EPHOURS)) + 
  labs(x="Open Hours for EPCOT", y="Density", title="Density Plot of EPCOT Open Hours")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Other Plots
-----------

Proximity to Holiday in days.

```{r Proximity to Holiday}
ggplot(SE_fit, aes(x=SE_fit$HOLIDAYPX, y=SE_fit$SPOSTMIN)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x="Proximity in days to a Holiday", y="Posted Wait Time (Minutes)", title="Posted Wait Time to Proximity to Holiday")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Open hours for EPCOT including Extra Magic Hours. 

```{r Total Open Hours including EMH}
ggplot(SE_fit, aes(x=SE_fit$EPHOURSEMH, y=SE_fit$SPOSTMIN)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x="Total Opening Hours", y="Posted Wait Time (Minutes)", title="Total Open Hours Including EMH")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Group By Analysis
-----------------

Just how many holidays exist in our data?

```{r Holiday Count}
ddply(SE_fit,.(HOLIDAY),summarise,COUNT=length(HOLIDAY))
```

Schools in session mean wait times.

```{r Schools in Session Mean Wait Time}
ddply(SE_fit,.(inSession_Cat), summarise, "Mean Posted Wait Time"=mean(SPOSTMIN))
```

Race day mean wait times.

```{r Race Day Mean Wait Time}
ddply(SE_fit,.(WDWrace), summarise, "Mean Posted Wait Time"=mean(SPOSTMIN))
```

Holidays and events mean wait times.

```{r Holiday and Event Mean Wait Time}
ddply(SE_fit,.(HOLIDAY, WDWevent), summarise, "Mean Posted Wait Time"=mean(SPOSTMIN))
```


Let's try out some models!

```{r Write Out Data Frames}
saveRDS(SE_fit, file="Data/SE_fit.rds")
saveRDS(SE_test, file="Data/SE_test.rds")
saveRDS(SpaceshipEarth_meta, file="Data/SpaceshipEarth_meta.rds")
```

```{r End, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="XKCD Comic - Training Models"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/xkcd1.png")
```
